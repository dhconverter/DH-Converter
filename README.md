# DH Converter
Dishonored Calendar Conversion v.0.0.8

The above code converts any selected date to the calendar used within the games Dishonored, Dishonored 2 and Dishonored: Death of the Outsider by Arkane Studios. 

This is a fan-made project based on the DH 2 Calendar Hypothesis by Drer. <https://archive.fo/wwAYG> This is a hypothetical conversion and is no way canonized by or affiliated with Arkane Studios. There are numerous other calendar hypothesis, but the one utilized for this script relies on the above linked conversion.

Some things to note: 
* The Fugue Feast begins on July 16th, and continues for an undetermined amount of time. For this reason only two days of 'Fugue' appear on the calendar, July 16th and July 17th. 
* The Month of Harvest falls within the Empire's summer, The Month of Wind within its fall, and The Months of Darkness, High Cold and Ice within its winter. They have been mapped as closely as possible to align with our real world seasons in this script.

Thank you for reading, and please enjoy!
